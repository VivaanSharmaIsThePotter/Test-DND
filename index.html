                <h3 class="headings">What is Dungeons & Dragons?</h3>
                <p>Dungeons & Dragons, or D&D, is a fun and imaginative game to play with family and friends. 
                You can learn valuable skills like teamwork, problem solving skills and how to solve problems creatively 
                and in an out of the box style. The best part is that you are a High Fantasy Characters on an Adventure! 
                Dungeons and Dragons is also a Role Playing Game or an RPG. That means we have to get into character and 
                act, speak, and think like the character. This helps to also enhance your imagination and think from 
                different perspectives.</p>

                <h3 class="headings">How do you play it?</h3>
                <p>The gameplay is simple. There are multiple players, preferably 2-6, and one dungeon master. The Dungeon Master, 
                or DM, places obstacles, monsters, bad guys and other stuff for the players to overcome. You also need Dice. 
                Lots of Dice! The Dice include - D4, D6, D8, D10, D% (or percentile), D12 and, the most useful, powerful and important, 
                D20. D is just die and the number after it signifies the number of sides the dice has. As for the D%, it has 10 sides 
                and is used in conjunction with the D10 to find a number out of 100. For now, the D20 is the one you'll use most often 
                and the one we have to learn about. Now, in D&D, we can't just say to the DM that you want to do this and that. No, 
                we will have to roll the D20 to know if we have succeeded in completing the task or have we failed. According to the role, 
                the DM will describe what you do, see, speak etc. Now, that is a lot to take in. For more information on how to play, 
                watch the video by The Dungeoncast - D&D Explained in 5 minutes.</p>
